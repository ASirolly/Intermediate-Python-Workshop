# Python Logic Intermediate Workshop

## If you havent already:
    install python 3.x.x - https://python.org (Anaconda will take too long to install)
    install text editor of your choice - https://code.visualstudio.com <- I'll be using this
                                         https://atom.io
                                         https://sublimetext.com
    in terminal or command prompt - type 'python --version' (no quotes) like below
    make sure Python 3.6.5 or something similar appears

    Unlike last time we're going to be coding together so we'll need all the tools installed on our computer
    we're also going to be working with some files on our computer, so an online text editor like repl.it won't be able run our program correctly.

    the files we're going to be using are on my github at:
    https://github.com/ASirolly/Intermediate-Python-Workshop
    Place it in a location easy to access like in Documents or Desktop

    also a friendly reminder to please mute your mics and disable webcams when you join!
    If there are any problems getting things to run or questions reguarding it, post them in chat. If I dont get anything I'll assume everything is working properly on your end!
